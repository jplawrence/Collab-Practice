#  HI if you wanna practice how to create a pull request then follow these steps:- 

<ul>
  <li>
Fork this repository to your own github profile 
  (Which will make a copy of this repository in your git account
    which is linked to my repository where you fork it from.)
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a fork button in the top-right corner of the repo
      </li>
      <li>
        So now the repo in my account is original repo
        And the copied repo in your account is a forked repo
      </li>
</li>
<li>
  Then clone the forked repository into your computer
  <ul>
    <li>
        To clone it you have to copy the link of your forked repo 
        Click on the arrow next to the green code button in your repo
        And copy the link from there
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to your pc make open git bash or anything similar and use this command
    </li>
    <li>
       git clone <copied_link_here>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Then create a branch aside from the default master branch using
  <ul>
    <li>
      git branch <new_branch_name>
    </li>
    <li>
      git checkout <new_branch_name>
      The <git checkout> command is used so you can switch to that branch
      And all the change and commits will be made in this branch
      WE should alwaws create new branch for new feature, bug fix and any changes.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Then write some lines at the end of this(readme.txt) file.
</li>
<li>
  Add and Commit those changes.
</li>  
<li>
  Then push these to your remote repo as how you usually do
</li>
<p>
  Remember to push your <new_branch> the one your created not the master branch
</p>
<li>
  Then go to your repo and you can see a new option <Comare & Pull Request>
</li>
<li>
  Then the rest should be easy
</li>
